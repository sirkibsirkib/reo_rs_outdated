# Reo-in-Rust
This library is part of [the Reo projec](http://reo.project.cwi.nl/v2/) at at the [CWI, Amsterdam](https://www.cwi.nl/). The library offers primitives of a Reo circuit for the Rust programming language. While one could write a Reo-like application by hand, this library is intended as a dependency for the [Reo Compiler](https://benjaminlion.fr/reo/installation.html).

More information TBA.
