The Reo compiler is able to translate a textual protocol specification into source code in several target languages. Currently, low-level systems languages such as Rust are not supported. We discuss the (1) development of a type system for the Reo compiler such that affine and relevant types can be represented, (2) differences between the new and existing backends, and (3) changes to the runtime API for added safety and performance.
