# To discuss

## Booking parents' flights

## TA on Wed

## Show ideas RE types and constraints _(in types.md)_

## Expansion Points

0. TODO Rust-Reo runtime + string templates
	* Memory cells

1. Introduce type-contraints and type checking for Reo:
	* allowing more types while preserving correctness
	* while minimizing unnecessary with s.t. it's still performant.

2. Scheme for dynamic reconfigurations.
	* allow definition of an interactive application that allows changing of
	* the protocol and 

3. Protocol fragmentation (into synchronous regions)
	* more parallelism
	* more incremental dynamic reconfig

4. Optimizing the protocol component:
	* event registration and static analysis of affected regions
	* bitmaps for readiness etc.
	* removing protocol threads

5. Interactive protocol optimizer? Suggests relaxations that collapse the proto
