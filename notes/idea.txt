the following needs to hold in general:
1. every ADDED ready-bit needs to be followed by a check of all guards. (may have become ready)
2. a putter's datum must be moved or dropped before it may put again
3. a putter's datum cannot be altered before all readers are done reading it



threadless without memory:
ready bitset has only two kinds of bit:
1. putter is ready
2. getter is ready

PUTTER:
1. updates their datum.
2. invokes ARRIVE
3. waits in a loop
getter arrives. C
