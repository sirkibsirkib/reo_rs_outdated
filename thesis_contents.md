#Background
## Concepts
1. Parallelism, Concurrency and Modularity
2. Computation vs Coordination
3. Contraint, Port and Reo Automata
4. RBA and Term Rewriting
5. Static vs dynamic work

## Reo
1. Protocols
2. Components, ports and composition
3. Compiler & ecosystem
4. Java Backend

## Rust
1. overview
2. relation with other languages
3. affinity and ownership
4. static vs dynamic: types and enums
5. traits: monomorphism & dynamic dispatch


# Project
## Goal
1. high level goal
2. Relationship to previous work

## Reo Type System
1. mutable aliasing
2. Data replication
3. 

## Rust Backend
1. Threadless protocols
2. Stack-passing
3. stuffed pointers
4. signals
5. consumption and unused put-values
4. relevant and linear types
5. reo templates vs libraries
6. API tool
6. main tool


## Atomic Safety
1. port-wait deadlock
3. token types & affinity
2. preventative vs optimistic
3. CA
5. RBA: 'always ready for anything'
4. RBA: convert to CA
6. RBA: TRS total
7. RBA: TRS approximate
8. protocol choice

# Implementation
1. threaded vs threaded protocol
2. events
3. control messaging: channels as locks
4. 

# Experimentation
1. various rust vs. rust experiments
2. rust vs java experiments
3. protected API vs unprotected API
4. 

# Future work
1. preference
2. runtime reconfiguration
3. runtime protocol composition
4. 

# Conclusion
